|[1.](#kinematic)|Kinematic modeling and control of serial-link robotic manipulators using DQ Robotics: From zero to hero|
## Kinematic modeling and control of serial-link robotic manipulators
A crash course on the kinematic modeling and control of robotic manipulators. Start from the very basic mathematical operations available in MATLAB to constrained control of multiple manipulators with degrees-of-freedom.
### Instructions

1. Install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
2. Download and install the latest version of [DQRobotics Toolbox](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/releases).
3. Clone the repository localy `git clone https://github.com/dqrobotics/learning-dqrobotics-in-matlab.git` and run each lesson.
4. Report any problems you might have at the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/dqrobotics/learning-dqrobotics-in-matlab/issues).
