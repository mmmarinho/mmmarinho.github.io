I am an assistant professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. I am currently a member of the [Mitsuishi-Harada laboratory](http://www.nml.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index-e.html).

I have a B.Sc. (2012) in Mechatronics Engineering and M.Sc. (2014) in Electronic Systems and Automation Engineering from the [University of Brasilia](http://www.alunoestrangeiro.unb.br/en/about-institution). I obtained a Ph.D. (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html).

My research interests are mostly in the field of robotics applied to medicine. I also have some works in robot control theory and image processing.
