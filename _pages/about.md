I am an assistant professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. I am currently a member of the Harada Laboratory (formely [Mitsuishi-Harada laboratory](http://www.nml.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index-e.html)).

I have a B.Sc. (2012) in Mechatronics Engineering and M.Sc. (2014) in Electronic Systems and Automation Engineering from the [University of Brasilia](http://international.unb.br/). I obtained a Ph.D. (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html).

Currently, my [research deliverables](https://mmmarinho.github.io/publications/) are mostly in the field of teleoperated and/or (semi-)automomous robots applied to [medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dayuW47PKKc&list=TLGGLlmonU1w7aAyMjA5MjAyMQ). Most notably
- Pediatric ([RA-L2020](http://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2019.2963642), [T-MRB2021](http://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2021.3049878))
- Ophtamology ([T-MRB2022](http://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2022.3147033))
- Neurosurgery ([T-RO2019](http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2019.2920078), [IJMRCAS2020](http://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2053))

Those implementations are based on a solid (constrained kinematic) robot control framework suitable for all sorts of robots.
- (Adaptive) constrained kinematic control ([T-RO2019](http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2019.2920078) and [T-RO2022](http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2022.3181047)). 
- Software implementation and system integration ([RAM2021](http://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2020.2997920) and [IJMRCAS2020](http://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2053))

I also have a few works in image processing (mostly for robotics) (e.g. [IJCARS2020](http://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02185-0)).
