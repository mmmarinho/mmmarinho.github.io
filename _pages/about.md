I am a Lecturer in Robotics with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), Manchester, UK. I am currently based at [RAICo1](https://hotrobotics.co.uk/facilities/university-of-manchester-2/). I hold a visitor scholar position (客員研究員) at the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, at the [Harada Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cdbim-medical-devices/home?authuser=0).

I have a BS (2012) in Mechatronics Engineering and MS (2014) in Electronic Systems and Automation Engineering from the [University of Brasilia](http://international.unb.br/). I obtained a PhD (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html). I was an Assistant Professor (助教) at the University of Tokyo until late 2023.

### Opportunities

Open opportunities (if any) for Ph.D and PDRA in my group are posted on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/murilo-marques-marinho-046178252/), the [robotics-worldwide mailing list](https://www.lists.kit.edu/sympa/subscribe/robotics-worldwide), [UoM jobs page](https://www.jobs.manchester.ac.uk/Home/Job), and [FindAPhd](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/department-of-electronic-and-electrical-engineering/?c00jh440&Keywords=marinho) (when applicable).

Prospective MSc students must refer to the [Robotics MSc](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/20967/msc-robotics/#course-profile) and [Robotics MSc with Extended Research](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/21031/msc-robotics-with-extended-research/). Bespoke MSc Project Dissertation topics from students in other MScs (e.g. [ACSE MSc](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/04166/msc-advanced-control-and-systems-engineering/)) will be evaluated on a case by case basis according to university guidelines.

### Research 

My work has been focused on teleoperated and/or (semi-)automomous robots applied to [medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dayuW47PKKc&list=TLGGLlmonU1w7aAyMjA5MjAyMQ) and [scientific exploration](https://aiscienceplatform.github.io). Notably
- Pediatric surgery: [ICRA19](http://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794363), [RAL20](http://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2019.2963642), [T-MRB21](http://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2021.3049878), and [JMRCAS23](http://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2476).
- Eye surgery: [T-MRB22](http://doi.org/10.1109/TMRB.2022.3147033), [ICRA23](http://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160795), and [IJMRCAS25](http://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.70040).
- Neurosurgery: [T-RO19](http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2019.2920078) and [IJMRCAS20](http://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2053).
- Scientific exploration: [IROS23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12265), [RAM24](http://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2023.3336472), and [ICRA24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10287).


Those implementations are based on a rigourous constrained kinematic robot control framework suitable for all sorts of robots.
- (Adaptive) constrained kinematic control: [T-RO19](http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2019.2920078) and [T-RO22](http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2022.3181047). 
- Software implementation and system integration: [IJMRCAS20](http://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2053), [RAM21](http://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2020.2997920), and [RAM24](http://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2023.3336472).

I also have a few works in *pure* image processing, mostly related to robotics, e.g. [IJCARS20](http://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02185-0), [ICRA20](http://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196779), and [IROS21](http://doi.org/10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636404).
