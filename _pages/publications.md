My pre-prints are almost always available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Marinho%2C+M+M).
After acceptance, I update arXiv with the accepted manuscript in accordance to the publisher's green open-access policy (e.g. [IEEE's Policy](https://open.ieee.org/index.php/about-ieee-open-access/faqs/)).
