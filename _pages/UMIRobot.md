The UMIRobot is a open {hardware, software} (5+1) robotic platform developed for online and hybrid learning courses.
The (under)graduate level students are divided into groups and have to design a gripper and a master control.

## Software

There are two main software components related to the UMIRobot. 

### (A) [umirobot-arduino](https://github.com/mmmarinho/umirobot-arduino)

The Arduino example sketch must be uploaded to the Arduino connected to your UMIRobot.
1. Install the UMIRobot Arduino library [[Instructions]](https://www.ardu-badge.com/UMIRobot).
2. Upload the UMIRobot sketch to your Arduino.

### (B) [umirobot-py](https://github.com/mmmarinho/umirobot-py)

You can interact with your UMIRobot through your computer using a python-based program.
In a computer with a `Python >= 3.8` enviroment:
1. Create a `venv`
2. Install the `umirobot` package
3. Run the module with `python3 -m umirobot`
4. Rejoice
