In this talk, I made a brief introduction on surgery, minimally invasive surgery, and robot assisted minimally invasive surgery. After introducing the unsolved problems regarding surgical robots, I showed what we have been doing at the Mitsuishi-Harada laboratory to solve those issues. Lastly, I presented some of my own research.
